# Day 01 - What is Cilium?

## Introduction

What is Cilium? Good question.

I tend to describe it broadly as a "cloud networking, security and observability platform".

Yeah, I know it doesn't exactly roll of the tongue. 

The thing is - Cilium can be many things.

Cilium is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin and what it is mostly known as.

Cilium is a firewall.

Cilium is a load-balancer.

Cilium is a proxy.

Cilium is (kinda) like a DHCP server.

Cilium is (kinda) like a VPN.

Cilium is a BGP-capable router.

Cilium is a NAT Gateway.

Cilium is a Service Mesh.

Cilium is a Service Controller.

Cilium is (kinda) like `tcpdump`.

That's why I end up calling it a "cloud networking, security and observability platform" - it can do *a lot of* things. 

And, most importantly, it can do a lot of things *well*. It is powered by a revolutionary Linux technology called eBPF. 

eBPF is what makes Cilium so fast - and why features keep being added to Cilium at pace - but in many ways, it's slightly irrelevant. You can use and become a Cilium expert without having to learn anything about eBPF. But you might find it interesting and it explains
