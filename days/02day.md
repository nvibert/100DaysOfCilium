# Day 02 - Why should I care?

Maybe you don't need to care about Cilium.

Seriously - there are a gazillion technologies out there and this might not be relevant to you. 

Maybe you're better off learning some AI stuff.

But if you happen to be involved in the world of:

- DevOps / Platform Engineering
- Networking
- Cloud like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud
- Kubernetes

Then it's very likely you're going to run into Cilium, if you haven't already.

## What should I know before I dedicate 100 Days of my life to this stuff?

Actually - let's break this down into 3 parts.

### What is the knowledge required to undertake the 100 Days of Cilium?

Pretty much all the hands-on you will be doing will be on Kubernetes clusters. There's just no way around it - you have to know *some* Kubernetes. 

I don't even expect you to run Kubernetes in production but I will expect you to have played with it - in home labs, on training courses, at work - but I won't put an artifical barrier (I started learning Cilium with a modest experience of Kubernetes and I did OK. I'm sure you will too). 

There are many courses that explain Kubernetes better than I ever could.

So I am expecting you to know about the following concepts:

- Containerised applications
- General DevOps culture and practices knowledges
- Why Kubernetes?
- Kubernetes Architecture and Concepts, including Nodes, Pods, Services, Deployments
- Interacting with the Kubernetes API with `kubectl`
- Linux
- YAML
- Cloud Architecture concepts

You don't have to be a Linux wizard - I am certainly not - or be CKA certified - I am not either - but you won't enjoy this Cilium journey (for lack of a better word) if you've never touched Kubernetes.

And given that Cilium is a Cloud Networking Platform, well, you should know the basics of:

- TCP/IP Networking
- Firewalling and Networkg Security
- Load Balancing

Again - you don't have to be a networking or BGP expert (I will explain some of the basics where appropriate) but I will just assume a certain minimum level of knowledge (otherwise, well, this will just take me forever to do and will be boring for the people this should reapply to).

### Who is this for?



### What will I learn ?

Well, you will learn what Cilium can do, how it works, its overall architecture and you will learn about many of the use cases it can help you with.
You will learn to install and configure Cilium. You will learn how to monitor it. 

You will learn how it works under the hood.

You will learn why some people start using it. 

You will learn where you get Cilium, even if you don't know it's there.

### How will I learn ?

You will learn by **reading**. There will be one guide such as this one for each day. I will add some links to docs, blog posts and other tutorials if you want to dive deeper.

You will learn by **doing**. There will be labs you can follow, either on your laptop or by going over to our labs over on [Isovalent.com](https://www.isovalent.com/labs).

You will learn by **watching**. I *intend* to record some videos for each day and I will also point you in the direction of videos already published on the respective Cilium and Isovalent YouTube channels.
