# 100DaysOfCilium
A repo where you can learn and try 100 different aspects and features of Cilium.

## Purpose

This repo will help you learn 100 features and concepts of Cilium, the cloud networking platform. 

- Interested in becoming more proficient in Kubernetes networking?
- Are you Interested in Cilium but don't really know yet what it is about? 
- Already familiar with Cilium but looking at additional use cases ? 
- Think you're already a Cilium Jedi but want to test yourself?

If you've answered Yes to any of these questions, then this repo might be for you.

Vaguely inspired by Michael Cade's excellent [90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) repo, this repo will provide a similar approach, albeit strictly focused on Cilium and related projects like Hubble and Tetragon.

## Structure

Each feature or concept will be covered in a day or a series of days.

You don't have to strictly follow them in order, although the sequence of days was designed in a logical order.

Most guides will provide simple instructions to install and deploy Cilium to let you test on your own machine.

## Feedback and issues

Please submit issues on this repo if you spot any mistakes.
